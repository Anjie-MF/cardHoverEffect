I am trying to complete this Frontend Mentor project {https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U/hub}.

However, I have never done this effect before so I went the Discord. It was full of information but it was like gibberish to me. So, I 
found an AMAZING(!!) tutorial on Youtube : (https://youtu.be/3RvQJX1_fKQ?si=KhYF2nccYqsxcebM)https://youtu.be/3RvQJX1_fKQ?si=KhYF2nccYqsxcebM 

The creator explained each line of code which is really helpful for new coders such as myself. Really proud of my little card <3. Enjoy!!
